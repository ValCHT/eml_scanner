# SOC Email Triage POC

Implementation repository prepared from the frozen V1.2 specification dated 18/09/2026.
No product ticket has been executed in this starter repository.

## Repository map

- `AGENTS.md` — canonical instructions for Codex and OpenCode.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code entry point importing `AGENTS.md`.
- `opencode.jsonc` — project permissions for OpenCode V2; no model is hard-coded.
- `docs/` — active normative architecture/contracts/gates and domain documents.
- `docs/tickets/` — TICKET-01 … TICKET-18. Execute one ticket per agent session.
- `docs/spec/` — frozen V1.2 audit snapshot, changelog, QA, matrix and research inspections.
- `prompts/` — runtime INTERNAL / FINAL prompts.
- `schemas/` — runtime JSON schemas.
- `ops/` — human/agent runbooks and repository setup helpers. Not runtime code.
- `.github/workflows/cross-platform.yml` — non-live test matrix for Python 3.11 on Linux/macOS/Windows once G0 creates the package.

## Recommended implementation workflow

Use one Git branch per implementation gate and one commit per ticket:

- `gate/g0`: TICKET-01, then TICKET-02
- `gate/g1`: TICKET-03
- `gate/g2`: TICKET-04
- `gate/g3`: TICKET-05
- `gate/g4`: TICKET-06 → 08
- `gate/g5`: TICKET-09 → 11
- `gate/g6`: TICKET-12 → 14
- optional G7 branches only if selected
- TICKET-18 only after the experiment is frozen and the holdout is released by the evaluator

Start a fresh OpenCode session for every ticket. Do not reuse the previous ticket's conversational context as a source of truth; the filesystem, Git history and ticket are the state.

## OpenCode Go

1. Start OpenCode at repository root.
2. Connect the **OpenCode Go** provider with `/connect`.
3. Use `/models` and select the current Go model you intend to use (GLM-5.3-Flash is available in the Go catalogue as of 18/09/2026).
4. Do **not** run `/init`: this repository already contains the reviewed `AGENTS.md`.
5. In a fresh session, run `/ticket 01`.
6. Review the diff and validation output before committing.

See `ops/OPENCODE_GO_RUNBOOK.md` for the full sequence.

## Cross-platform rule

Application/runtime behavior must not depend on the user's shell. After activating a Python 3.11 virtual environment, commands should use `python -m ...` and work on Windows, macOS and Linux. CI runs non-live tests on all three operating systems.

RFC822 `.eml` files are byte-sensitive. `.gitattributes` deliberately disables Git text normalization for them.

## First implementation step

The first implementation task is `docs/tickets/TICKET-01.md`.
Do not implement TICKET-02 until TICKET-01 is DONE and its changes are reviewed/committed.
